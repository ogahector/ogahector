## About Me

I'm Hector Oga, a soon-to-be graduate electronics and embedded systems engineer with a passion for instrumentation, precision hardware, and automotive-tech applications. I'm especially proud of my work on **high-precision instruments**, **real-time embedded firmware**, and **control-focused DSP**. These are skills that I aim to bring into the world of control and instrumentation.

I also speak French, Spanish, and English, and have lived in 7 different countries!

## Projects (Newest first)

### [Precision Impedance Analyzer (2025)](https://github.com/ogahector/complex_Z_meter)

- Sub-1% error impedance analyser ($1kHz - 2 MHz$, $10 - 1M\Omega$)
- The IQ (In-phase/Quadrature) method for precise impedance extraction, implementing my own DSP framework using phasors and complex numbers
- PCB topology and design practices, minimizing parasitics to preserve signal integrity
- Firmware: STM32 bare-metal DAC/ADC with IQ demodulation
- Python GUI for real-time measurement and RLC fitting
- Complete hardware, software, and GUI stack delivered

### [Music Synthesiser with DOOM](https://github.com/ogahector/synth_player)

- Music synthesiser capable of playing notes, with volume and octave control, recording functionality, changing waveform abilities
- Developed and optimised custom waveform synthesis
- Successfully implemented DMA and ping pong buffer access for real-time reads and writes to the same buffer through the STM32 HAL for a dramatic increase in performance of at least 300% over built-in methods
- Performed critical instant analysis of the rate monotonic scheduler, deadlock analysis, and oversaw shared resource managing

### [PiTrainer: AI-Powered Personal Gym Coach Embedded System](https://github.com/lolzio5/PiTrainer)

- Custom-trained machine learning model to analyse gym rep quality
- RaspberryPi in Python to collect accelerometer and magnetometer data, analyse reps using advanced signal processing methods
- Implemented real-time telemetry on a dual-sensor system. Built I2C interface to streamline speed and remove bloat
- Used statistical Kalman Filtering and sensor fusion algorithms for real-time denoising performance
- Leveraged machine learning to give a score based on workout quality.
